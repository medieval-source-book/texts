                <p>The Sultan’s Daughter in the Flower Garden is a 400-line rhymed couplet text in Middle High German that was probably composed anonymously in the 14th century. Categorized in scholarship as a “Klosterlegende”  or monastery legend, but also exhibiting characteristics of saints’ lives, courtship narratives, stories of noble “heathens” who convert, as well as of docta ignorantia (learned ignorance) and Marian literature, the narrative was probably translated from a no longer extant Latin source and is also transmitted in low German prose versions, as well as in song form. While the prose versions have a “modest” transmission in late medieval manuscripts and early modern prints, the songs’ reception stretches into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The Middle High German rhymed couplet version presented here appears, however, in only two late fifteenth-century manuscripts: Berlin, Staatsbibiliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz, mgo 222, dated to after 1475, and Budapest, Bibl. et Archivum P. P. Franciscanorum, Cod. Esztergom 11, dated to around 1500. Both manuscripts were produced in the southern German-speaking areas and tell the following story: After learning of the arrival of a foreign nobleman whom her father wishes her to wed, the daughter of the Sultan of Babylon goes into their beautiful garden. Among the flowers, she marvels at the beauty of the lilies, whereupon an angel appears and recruits her to worship the God who made them, as long as she can commit to complete chastity. She agrees and he whisks her 3000 miles away, instructing her in the Christian mysteries along the way. The angel delivers her to a convent. where she is accepted, baptized, educated, and eventually becomes abbess.</p>
                <p>The dominant aspects of the tale situate it most comfortably in the traditions of Marian literature and docta ignorantia narratives. The references to lilies, to chastity, and to the annunciation from the angel in an enclosed garden come into greater relief in the Berlin manuscript compilation, which includes a number of other texts relating to the Marian tradition (e.g., a pater noster exegesis, a treatise about the rosary, a devotion to Mary, a set of Marian miracles, and an allegory about the heart as cloister). This focus corresponds to the known ownership of the manuscript, which, as indicated in the pastedown on the inside front cover, was a reformed convent of Augustinian nuns in Inzigkofen, a town located about 25 miles north of Lake Constance. In contrast, the Budapest manuscript, most likely produced in a Franciscan context, seems more interested in instructing an audience of lay noblemen in the benefits of giving up their sinful behavior and embracing a more chaste existence for the sake of their fate in the afterlife. Accordingly, the other texts included in the Budapest compilation, many more of which are in verse—as opposed to the Berlin manuscript, where only the Sultan’s Daughter text is rhymed—focus on the concepts of sin and confession (e.g., model confession texts, a Latin catalogue of sins, verse prayer for a good end, a Totentanz, the dream vision of Tundalus, a section from the Lucidarius on the afterlife, and two secular rhymed couplet tales: The Count of Savoy and The Knight in the Chapel).</p>
                <p>The text is noteworthy more for its content than for its poetic attributes, the rhymes and imagery being relatively mundane. The combination of the variety of narrative models into one tale is of interest, however, as well as the miraculous trajectory of the clever maiden from an object of exchange between men in Babylon to model Christian, scribe, teacher, and ultimately abbess of a German convent. In addition, the focus in the text on the choice to obey the angel, that is, on the maiden’s agency in determining her fate, is also striking.</p>

                    <p>The Middle High German text supplied here is based on Johannes Bolte’s 1890 edition, published in the Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum (volume 34, pages 18-31), which is a diplomatic transcription of the Berlin manuscript (fols. 160r–170v). I have adopted Bolte’s diacritics where possible. These include the regular umlaut as well as an accent aigu (´), which Bolte also used to indicate an umlauted vowel (presumably because the superscript e in the manuscript looks more like an accent than an e). Dipthongized vowels like a, u, and o, which in the manuscript are indicated with superscripts, have been written out as av, uo, and ov. Superscript abbreviations for er, en, and em have been written out as well. The manuscript often uses a v to represent the vowel u and when this is umlauted, that is also indicated with what looks like an accent (instead of the umlaut or an e over the vowel). In the transcription here, these have been changed to ú (as in úmmer and úber). Bolte’s suggestions for emendations have been adopted and appear in square brackets. My own interjections appear in parentheses. I have also consulted, where necessary, both manuscripts as well as Vizkeletey’s edition of the Budapest manuscript published in 2013 (András Vizkelety, “‘Die Sultanstochter im Blumengarten’ in einer ehemaligen Güssinger Handschrift (A szultánkisasszony a virágok közt. Verses novella egy Németújvárról elszármazott kódexben); Tanulmányok Mollay Károly születésének 100. évfordulójára [Studien zum 100. Geburtstag von Karl Mollay],” Soproni Szemle [Ödenburger Rundschau] 4 (2013): 440–53), as indicated in the footnotes.</p>
