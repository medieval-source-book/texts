        			<p>The original text of this ci is based on the edition by Tang Guizhang 唐圭璋 (Quan Song Ci 全宋詞. Vol 2. Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1965). Punctuation follows the edition. Since ci poetry rarely includes personal pronouns, and gender-differentiated pronouns did not exist in Classical Chinese of this period, the gender of the speaker as well as their perspective (e.g. first, second or third person) must often be deduced by the translator from context.</p>

						<rdg wit="#Translation">Let me lie beside these beauties<note type= "critical" anchored="true"><p>The literal translation for “紅翠” is “the red and the green”, which refers to prostitutes. This comes from a self-description by Li Yu 李煜 (c. 937 – 978) the last ruler of the Southern Tang state during imperial China's Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Despite being an unsuccessful ruler, Li Yu was known as the "first true master" of the <hi rend="italic">ci</hi> form, and he described himself as “the one who drinks wine and hums tunes, the master of lying beside the beauties (the red and the green), and the king of the temple of mandarin ducks” (“浅斟低唱，偎红倚翠大师，鸳鸯寺主”). Note that the mandarin duck is also a symbol for marriage or romance. Liu Yong here is trying to compare himself to Li Yu. The final line of this <hi rend="italic">ci</hi> also borrows a phrase from Li Yu’s self-description.</p></note>—</rdg>
