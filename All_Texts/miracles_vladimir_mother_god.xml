				<p>The “Legend of the Miracles of the Vladimir Mother of God Icon” is a 15th-century text relating a series of ten miracles performed by the Vladimir Mother of God icon in the late 12th century. Widely regarded as one of the most sacred icons in Russian history, the Vladimir Mother of God, painted with tempera on wood in the 12th century, depicts the Virgin Mary embracing Christ the child cheek to cheek. Dressed in gold, Christ gazes up at his mother adoringly. This tender pose is emblematic of a genre of icons called an “Icon of Loving Tenderness,”— or umilenie in Russian — and is meant to remind the viewer of the love uniting Mary and Christ. </p>
				<p>The Vladimir Mother of God Icon was brought to Kiev from Byzantium in 1131-32 and remained there until 1155, when Prince Andrei Bogoliubsky decided to move the icon to his new capital city of Vladimir in the Rostov-Suzdal principality in northeastern Rus (approximately 120 miles northeast of Moscow). Prince Andrei honored the icon by decorating it with a silver riza — a metal covering meant to protect icons from damage— bejeweled with precious metals and stones. He then built the Dormition Cathedral in 1158 in the icon’s honor and placed it inside, where the icon served thereafter as the symbolic religious protector and benefactor of Vladimir. </p>
				<p>It is likely that Prince Andrei himself was involved in creating the initial cycle of legends in order to legitimize Vladimir as the new political and spiritual capital of Rus. This is especially plausible considering that Andrei is a witness to many of the miracles described in the “Legend,” one of which includes details about the birth of his own child. The “Legend” begins by comparing the Mother of God icon to the sun, stating that both have the ability to traverse and warm the entire universe, a message that suggests Prince Andrei’s ambitions to unite several principalities of northern Rus under his rule. This underlying political agenda is prevalent in the geographical scope of the “Legend,” which suggests Prince Andrei’s spreading glory since the miracles do not only occur in Prince Andrei’s capital city of Vladimir and its surrounding environs, but also in more distant cities such as Murom, Tver, and Pereiaslavl.</p>
				<p>In many 16th-century manuscripts, the miracles are preceded by the “Legend of the Victory over the Volga Bulgars” of 1164, the story of how Prince Andrei defeated the Volga Bulgars with the help of a miracle by the Mother of God icon, which Andrei carried throughout the campaign in the vanguard of the army. In contrast, the “Legend of the Vladimir Mother of God Icon” depicts the everyday realities of 12th-century Rus, using colloquial language and expressive dialogue. These are not miracles relating military victories, but instead empathetic vignettes of women suffering from complicated pregnancies, a teenage boy with a mysterious eye disease, and people grappling with blindness and heart disease. In each case, the intervention of the Mother of God icon cures the afflicted, bringing peace and stability to the people of Vladimir and beyond.</p>
				<p>The Vladimir Mother of God icon continued to serve as a symbol of Russian imperial and national destiny throughout Russia’s history. The Ermolin Chronicle of the 1470s attributes the Grand Prince Vasily I’s victory over the Mongol ruler Tamerlane in 1395 to the icon’s intervention. The Romanovs kept the icon in the Kremlin as a symbol of Russia’s link to the historical center of Christianity in Byzantium. Tsar Nicholas II and his family traveled to the Moscow Kremlin when the Germans invaded Russia in 1914, where they kissed the icon and asked it to protect Russia from harm. Legend has it that when German forces were approaching Moscow during World War II, Stalin ordered the icon to be put on a plane and flown around the capital city. And finally, during the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, the icon was removed from its current home in the State Tretyakov gallery and brought to the Epiphany Cathedral at Elokohovo, where the icon was asked to prevent civil war. By reading the “Legends of the Vladimir Mother of God Icon,” we can understand the origins of this powerful national symbol, which has come to signify Russia’s complex relationship between political power and Orthodox Christianity.</p>
				<p>The first cycle of legends regarding the Vladimir Mother of God icon was composed between 1163 and the late 1180s. According to scholars, these dates are indicated in a note in a later version of the legends, written in a menology— an ecclesiastical calendar containing biographies of Saints— by the Miliutin brothers in the 17th century. The first historical work that linked disparate legends regarding the miracles performed by the Mother of God into one cohesive narrative is the Book of Royal Degrees compiled in the circle of the Metropolitan Makarii of Moscow in the 1550s and 1560s. However, many earlier sources mention the icon’s history and the miracles caused by the icon’s direct intervention. For example, the Laurentian Chronicle compiled in the late 14th century tells of how the Mother of God icon was delivered from Constantinople to Kiev, while the 15th-century Ermonlin Chronicle describes the Virgin’s intercession in the battle against Tamerlane in 1395. The edition of the text of the “Legend” used for this translation comes from a late 15th-century manuscript, #637 from the Egorov Collection at the Russian State Library in Moscow (Collection 98). Egor Egorovich Egorov (1862–1917) was a Moscow merchant born into a family of Old Believers (a group of Eastern Orthodox Christians who maintain the practices of the Russian Orthodox Church as they were before the reforms of 1652 – 1666) who collected medieval manuscripts and art. </p>

						<rdg wit="#Translation">The Eighth Miracle. This was a new miracle of the Holy Mother of God regarding a woman named Euphemia. She had been sick with heart disease for seven years and sought a cure from many people but did not find one. And she summoned the priest Lazar and said: “What would help cure this disease?” The priest said: “If the Holy Mother of God will not heal you, then you will not get rid of the disease.” After hearing from him of the miracles performed by the water of the Holy Mother of God icon, she sent the priest to the Holy Mother of God in Vladimir with her earrings and golden head pendants, asking to bring her the holy water. And when he brought her the water and she drank it, she was cured of her disease that same day, and she began to eat and drink with joy. </rdg>

						<rdg wit="#Translation">The Ninth Miracle. And this happened in Tver. A certain woman was in labor for three days. And the Priest Lazar [and another priest] came and stayed with them. She asked about their health. He said: “We are well, but not very, since our mistress is close to death.” While they were talking, there came a request from her: “Holy fathers, come to me.” And she said to them: “I am not ashamed because I am close to death.” And Priest Lazar then said to her: “If you do not make a vow to the Holy Vladimir Mother of God, then you will not be cured.” And she made a vow and said to the priests: “Leave this place.” She ordered to give them food and drink. And news came from her that she had already given birth to a son and was herself in health. And, as she had promised, she sent her golden jewelry and earrings to the icon of the Holy Mother of God in Vladimir.  </rdg>

						<rdg wit="#Translation">The Tenth Miracle. The noble Prince Andrei built the golden gates for the feast of the Holy Mother of God and said to the boyars: “When people come to the feast they will see the gates.” When the feast day arrived and the people came to the gates, the lime in the gate had not yet dried. And suddenly the gate fell off the walls and onto the people, crushing twelve of them. When Prince Andrei heard of this, he began to pray and lament in front of the icon of the Holy Mother of God: “Most Pure Virgin Mother, if you do not save them, then I, a sinner, will be guilty of their deaths.” And he sent his boyar to provide all that was necessary to bury the dead. When the boyar arrived and the gate was lifted, the people underneath it were all alive and healthy. And hearing this, Prince Andrei was glad. And, seeing the miracle, the people marveled. </rdg>
