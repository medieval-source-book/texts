				<p>The Queen of France was composed in the late 14th century somewhere in the Alemannic region (what is today Southern Germany or Austria). Two of 24 surviving manuscripts name one “von Schondoch” as the author of The Queen of France. Aside from the name, nothing else is known about this person. The Queen of France is a prototypical melodramatic tale. There are similar texts in the medieval German tradition, but they are usually shorter. This verse narrative, composed in rhymed couplets, is also unique because of its wide transmission. The large number of textual witnesses and adaptations of the story, among them Elisabeth von Nassau-Saarbrücken’s famous prose novel Sibille (after 1437), suggest that The Queen of France was very popular in late medieval Germany.</p>
				<p>The Queen of France tells the story of a queen, a good and faithful wife, who is banished for alleged adultery by her husband, the king. Falsely accused by the king’s marshal, whose advances she had turned down earlier, the pregnant queen is saved from death by the intercession of the king’s nephew, the Duke of Austria. The queen is escorted away under the protection of a noble knight, who is assassinated by the villainous marshal. The queen, however, manages to elude the murderer, fleeing into the forest where she is sheltered by a virtuous, poor man. The story takes a turn for the better when the virtuous knight’s faithful dog persistently pursues his master’s murderer. The Duke of Austria sees to it that the dog and the marshal engage in a judicial ordeal whose outcome–the dog is victorious–exposes the marshal’s guilt. Ashamed and shocked by his error of judgement, the king bitterly regrets his actions and searches unsuccessfully for the queen for three and a half years. At last, a female merchant recognizes the queen’s exquisite needlework, which leads to the discovery of the queen and her three-year-old son, and the king and queen are reconciled.</p>
				<p>In The Queen of France medieval honor emerges as a core concept at multiple points throughout the story: as a commodity that can be both acquired and lost, and as a matter of reputation and respect, which was the basis of the rule of elites. This translation makes The Queen of France available to scholars who are working on topics such as popular tales, on the prototypes of modern melodrama, or on depictions of animals in literature.</p>
				<p>Heid. Hs. 1012, the version of The Queen of France that was used for this transcription and translation, was written around or before 1460 in the Moselle Franconian/Rhenish Franconian region (Siegen-Luxembourg/Kassel-Saarbrücken). The Queen of France is the final text of three in that manuscript. It is preceded by The Duke of Brunswick, a German rhymed couplet narrative; and by Loher and Maller, which is a German prose translation by Elisabeth von Nassau-Saarbrücken (or someone at her court) from a chanson de geste, an Old French heroic epic.</p>
				<p>Heid. Hs. 1012 tells The Queen of France in a manner focused on the queen's steadfastness and virtue. By adding lines and by expanding on specific themes (e.g. a comparison between the queen and the Virgin Mary and the king's explicit joy at discovering that the queen has lived a virtuous and pious life without him), this version emphasizes the "good wife" theme more than other versions, and in some cases suggests parallels with religious stories of martyrs and saints.</p>
				<p>This transcription and translation are based on the newly rediscovered Heidelberg, Universitätsbibliothek, Heid. Hs. 1012 (olim Ashburnham Place, Cod. 486), Die Königin von Frankreich: fol. 249r- 254v, dated 1463. This edition follows the manuscript in the following ways: u/v- spelling and i/j- spelling follow the manuscript; separate and compound spelling are not normalized but rather follow the manuscript; no punctuation has been added.</p>
				<p>To give a visual impression of the original manuscript’s structure this edition also recorded scribal corrections, deletions and additions, mostly indicated by the rubricator with red ink. Crossed out letters and words in the manuscript are crossed out in the edition as well. For the sake of the edition’s readability and following standard practice, abbreviations and diacritical signs are expanded (these expansions are unmarked), and the descending s (ſ) is replaced with the round s. In three places where Heid. Hs. 1012 appears to be flawed, amendments (see critical notes) follow Jutta Strippel's 1978 edition of The Queen of France.</p>

	        	<p>Transcriptions and translations are encoded in XML conforming to TEI (P5) guidelines. The original-language text is contained within &lt;lem&gt; tags and translations within &lt;rdg&gt; tags.</p>
        		<interpretation>
        			<p>Texts are translated into modern American English with maximum fidelity to the original text, except where it would impair comprehension or good style. Archaisms are preserved where they do not conflict with the aesthetic of the original text. Scribal errors and creative translation choices are marked and discussed in the critical notes.</p>
        			<p>u/v- spelling and i/j- spelling follow the manuscript, e.g. Heid. Hs. 1012 vnd > Standard Middle High German und; Heid. Hs. 1012 ouer > Standard Middle High German ober; Heid. Hs. 1012 dye > Standard Middle High German diu/die; Heid. Hs. 1012 lijff > Standard Middle High German lîp.</p>
        			<p>Separate and compound spelling are not normalized to standard Middle High German but rather follow the manuscript and no punctuation has been added (no periods, question marks, or exclamation points; no commas, semicolons, or colons; no dashes, or hyphens; no brackets, braces, or parentheses; and no apostrophes or quotation marks).</p>
        			<p>Scribal corrections, deletions and additions, mostly indicated by the rubricator with red ink, are recorded. Crossed out letters and words in the manuscript are crossed out in the edition as well.</p>
        			<p>For the sake of the edition’s readability and following standard practice abbreviations and diacritical signs are expanded, and the descending s (ſ), which appears internally and initially but not at the end of words, is replaced with the round s.</p>
        			<p>The rubricator’s red-ink flourishes have been disregarded after carefully analyzing their semiotic meaning. The flourishes are only used when there is an empty space on a line between the rhyme word, which is always placed at the end of a line, and the line delineating the end of the column. Which suggests that these flourishes are only decorative because they ensure that the manuscript looks uniform. The scribe at times ran out of room while writing and completed a line in an adjacent empty space. In some of these cases, the rubricator drew a red-ink line indicating where the final phrase belonged. These final phrases were added and marked by double slashes. This edition also follows the rubricator’s red-ink line indication in the manuscript, which at times deviates from the scribe’s lines. </p>
        			<p>In only three places, where Heid. Hs. 1012 appears to be flawed, it is amended in a clearly referenced manner. Additions in comparison to Strippel’s edition are marked by italics. Letters and words crossed out in Heid. Hs. 1012 are marked with a <hi rend="strikethrough">strikethrough</hi> and the final phrase of a line written in an adjacent empty space in Heid. Hs. 1012 is marked with double slash marks.</p>
