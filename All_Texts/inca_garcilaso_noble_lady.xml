				<p>This Quechua poem first appeared in the Spanish-language Comentarios Reales de los Incas (1609), a history of the Pre-Columbian Inca empire, authored by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the son of a Spanish conquistador and an Incan noblewoman. Scholars know very little beyond what Inca Garcilaso himself relates in his history about the poem. It appears in a chapter dedicated to the poetic accomplishments of the Incas, in which Inca Garcilaso accounts for the role that poetry played in how the Incas kept records of their achievements, cultural traditions, and beliefs. According to him, Inca poetry comprised “few verses, so that they could be memorized; but they were also very condensed, like cyphers to be decoded.” This description befits the poem translated here, “Sumaq Ñusta” (“Noble Lady”), in which few verses construct a whole narrative about the different forms of precipitation in the Andes (rain, thunderstorms, snow, hail). For Inca Garcilaso, poetry was the medium by which the Incas communicated not only their history, but also their knowledge about the natural world.</p>
				<p>Inca Garcilaso writes that Blas Valera, another mixed-race intellectual from colonial Peru, transcribed the poem from ancient khipus, the traditional system of record-keeping used by the Incas. (The khipu system recorded information using cords of different colors, into which small knots were tied, which could represent words, numbers, or concepts.) Valera translated the poem into Latin, keeping the original spondaic syllable structure of Quechua. In the Comentarios Reales, that Inca Garcilaso argues that Inca poetry was much closer to the poetry of the great ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome than it was to the Spanish culture of his own time, and he musters this poem as evidence. Both the Quechua and the Latin versions appear in the Comentarios Reales, to which Inca Garcilaso adds his own translation into Spanish, in which language he is unable to preserve the original spondaic meter. The English translation presented here is a direct translation from the Quechua original.</p>
				<p>The poem relates a story of the many forms that water takes when it falls from the sky, contrasting the violent rain during thunderstorms with gentler, and more useful, rain. The addressee of the poem is a woman of noble ascent—a ñusta, like Inca Garcilaso’s mother—who was chosen by the gods to regulate the various natural phenomena of precipitation. Although there is a predominant tone of gratitude towards the ñusta, whom the speaker thanks for sending water only in beneficial, unthreatening forms, the first half of the poem is an indirect, somewhat accusatory address. The accusation is not directed at the ñusta, but at her brother, whom the speaker credits with causing thunderstorms. It is because he breaks the ñusta’s water jug, instead of gently pouring water from it, that such storms occur. The story of these siblings features a binary idea of gender, which is mapped onto them: the brother is violent (he breaks the jug) and disrespectful (he usurps his sister’s role as trustee of the jug), whereas the sister is gentle and caring, even though she sends hail and snow at times. </p>
				<p>Moreover, this short poem constitutes a good example of how pre-modern Quechua culture relates to the material world by ascribing consciousness and intent to the rules by which the world is governed. While the ñusta and her brother are both of presumed royal ascent, they are not necessarily deities in the same way as, for example, the gods of the Greek pantheon (e.g. Zeus, Hera, Athena, etc.) were thought to be. The Incas believed that mountains and rivers had as much power and agency as human beings (if not more), and the nameless ñusta and her brother may fit better into this category of agents of nature. Although the gods Pachakamaq and Viraqucha chose the ñusta to govern precipitation, it is interesting to consider the importance of the object from which the water stems: the clay jug. The noble lady’s power is curtailed since the jug may be manipulated by others (i.e. her brother), suggesting that the jug itself may control the waters falling from the sky, and the ñusta and her brother simply guide the water’s form.</p>

        			<p>This poem was transcribed from the original edition of Comentarios Reales de los Incas (1609), printed in Lisbon. The John Carter Brown Library holds a copy of it, whose digitized version can be accessed here: https://archive.org/details/primerapartedelo00vega. Inca Garcilaso’s original spelling of Quechua has been modified to reflect modern-day spelling of the Ayacucho-Chanca variant of Quechua. The main difference here is the substitution of “q” for “c” to represent the guttural phoneme (non-existent in English), and the use of “k” instead of “c” for the voiceless velar stop phoneme (like the “c” in English, as it is pronounced in the word can). The translator has recorded a reading of the poem in Quechua for the Society of Renaissance and Baroque Hispanic Poetry, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvubEwuraZE&amp;t=7s.</p>

Finally, the <hi rend="italic">m</hi> at the end is a suffix that indicates a strong assertion.

The order of object-verb is switched in the translation to make it easier to understand; in modern and premodern Quechua, much like Latin, sentences normally end on a conjugated verb.

It is used as a particle for comparisons between two elements; it can function as a particle to trigger the subjunctive mood, much like the phrase “as if”; and it can also simply be used to refer to something previously mentioned, which is the case here.

For Inca Garcilaso, this verb shows an important feature of the Quechua language, namely that words normally have multiple meanings. This makes translating from Quechua particularly challenging for historians and scholars of Andean culture.</p></note></lem>

As the poem is about different forms of water that fall from the sky, I chose to correct the verb to <hi rend="italic">chikchiy</hi>, using the modern spelling. The suffix mu indicates the direction of an action. It is often accompanied, in modern Quechua, by another suffix (<hi rend="italic">wa</hi>), and it means in the direction of the speaker.</p></note></lem>

Future conjugation in Quechua is relatively complex when it includes, as it does here, directional particles that include the other persons within the scope of the action. It is interesting that Inca Garcilaso’s Spanish translation of the last two lines of the poem gives both these verbs in the past not the future: “Ya te colocaron / Y te dieron alma” (“Have already put you there / And have given you a soul”). To reflect the insight that Inca Garcilaso may have had into this grammatical form, I have chosen to use the future participle; in this way, I have sought to convey the future tense present in the original while also giving the impression that there is something already consummated about the action (<hi rend="italic">churay</hi>, which means to put, and <hi rend="italic">kamay</hi>, which means to create).</p></note></lem>
