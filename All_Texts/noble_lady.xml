						<lem wit="#Transcription">Turallaykim<note type= "critical" anchored="true"><p>Quechua is an agglutinant language. Words and sentences are formed by adding suffixes to them. In this case, <hi rend="italic">tura</hi> is the brother of a woman, <hi rend="italic">lla</hi> is a suffix that means “only” and is sometimes used as emphasis, <hi rend="italic">yki</hi> is the suffix that indicates the second-person possessive. Finally, the <hi rend="italic">m</hi> at the end is a suffix that indicates a strong assertion. I chose not to use “definitely only” to convey the sense of <hi rend="italic">lla</hi> and m because this kind of emphatic repetition, though normal and even desirable in Quechua, is not very organic to either English or Spanish.</p></note></lem>

						<lem wit="#Transcription">Pakirqayan<note type= "critical" anchored="true"><p>This unusual form is original to the source text, the <hi rend="italic">Comentarios Reales</hi>. It could be a different spelling of the verb <hi rend="italic">p’akirqariy</hi> (in the Cuzco-Collao variant) or <hi rend="italic">pakirqachiy</hi> (in the Ayacucho-Chanca variant). It means “to shatter”, and is conjugated in the third person present indicative. The order of object-verb is switched in the translation to make it easier to understand; in modern and premodern Quechua, much like Latin, sentences normally end on a conjugated verb. Given the language’s agglutinant nature and the presence of suffixes that demarcate the syntactical role of each word, word order is less important in Quechua than in either Spanish or English.</p></note></lem>

						<lem wit="#Transcription">Hinamantara<note type= "critical" anchored="true"><p><hi rend="italic">Hinamantara</hi> sounds like an archaic form of a consequential clause, <hi rend="italic">chaymanta</hi>, meaning “from that” or “because of that.” <hi rend="italic">Hina</hi> is a very interesting word, still in use in modern Quechua, which can have different meanings. It is used as a particle for comparisons between two elements; it can function as a particle to trigger the subjunctive mood, much like the phrase “as if”; and it can also simply be used to refer to something previously mentioned, which is the case here. Manta is the suffix that functions as the ablative of origin or cause in Latin, used to refer to both time and space.</p></note></lem>

						<lem wit="#Transcription">Illapantaq<note type= "critical" anchored="true"><p><hi rend="italic">Illapay</hi> is a verb that Inca Garcilaso comments on extensively in the <hi rend="italic">Comentarios Reales</hi>. He translates it as having three meanings, all referring to the phenomenon we call thunder: the thunder as a sound, the lightning bolt that appears, and the way it hits something on the ground. For Inca Garcilaso, this verb shows an important feature of the Quechua language, namely that words normally have multiple meanings. This makes translating from Quechua particularly challenging for historians and scholars of Andean culture.</p></note></lem>

It is normally used in conversation to turn the focus to the other person, as in “I am well, and you?” In this case, however, <hi rend="italic">rí</hi> seems to both turn attention to the <hi rend="italic">ñusta</hi> to whom the poem is addressed and also to create a sense of contrast between her benevolent role in generating natural phenomena (like rain or snow) and her brother’s violent one, which brings about storms.</p></note></lem>

Modern Quechua speakers could also say <hi rend="italic">yaku</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Yki</hi> is the possessive, again, explained in the first note, and ta is the suffix that indicates a direct object to the following three verbs: <hi rend="italic">paramunki</hi>, <hi rend="italic">chichimunki</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">ritimunki</hi>.</p></note></lem>

However, Inca Garcilaso’s transcription says <hi rend="italic">chichimunki</hi>, from the verb <hi rend="italic">chichiy</hi>, which means to germinate. As the poem is about different forms of water that fall from the sky, I chose to correct the verb to <hi rend="italic">chikchiy</hi>, using the modern spelling. The suffix mu indicates the direction of an action. It is often accompanied, in modern Quechua, by another suffix (<hi rend="italic">wa</hi>), and it means in the direction of the speaker.</p></note></lem>

						<lem wit="#Transcription">Pacharuwaq<note type= "critical" anchored="true"><p><hi rend="italic">Pacha</hi> is a complex word in Quechua, with many different meanings, including: earth, Earth, the world, time, clothes. In this case, it probably means “the world,” as it refers to the deity that made the world. <hi rend="italic">Ruwaq</hi> comes from the verb <hi rend="italic">ruway</hi>, to make. The <hi rend="italic">q</hi> is a suffix added to verbs to turn them into an adjective, in this case, “the one who makes,” or “maker, creator.” Although the original says <hi rend="italic">ruraq</hi>, I have chosen to modernize the spelling of the verb.</p></note></lem>

Here, as in the previous case, it refers to something that was previously mentioned (like the particle chay in modern Quechua). <hi rend="italic">Paq</hi> is the suffix that indicates purpose, meaning “because of that” or “for the benefit of,” somewhat equivalent to the dative case in Latin.</p></note></lem>

						<lem wit="#Transcription">Kamasunki<note type= "critical" anchored="true"><p>These two last verbs, <hi rend="italic">churay</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kamay</hi>, are in the third-person future form but have the suffix <hi rend="italic">ki</hi> added to them to indicate that, though the action is carried out by the third person, it impacts the second person. Future conjugation in Quechua is relatively complex when it includes, as it does here, directional particles that include the other persons within the scope of the action. It is interesting that Inca Garcilaso’s Spanish translation of the last two lines of the poem gives both these verbs in the past not the future: “Ya te colocaron / Y te dieron alma” (“Have already put you there / And have given you a soul”). To reflect the insight that Inca Garcilaso may have had into this grammatical form, I have chosen to use the future participle; in this way, I have sought to convey the future tense present in the original while also giving the impression that there is something already consummated about the action (<hi rend="italic">churay</hi>, which means to put, and <hi rend="italic">kamay</hi>, which means to create).</p></note></lem>
