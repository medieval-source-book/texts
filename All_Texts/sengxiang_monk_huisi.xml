				<p>Nanyue Huisi 南岳慧思was an eminent Buddhist monk who lived in Southern China between 515 and 577CE. Traditionally regarded as the third patriarch of the Tiantai 天台school of Chinese Buddhism, Huisi was the teacher of Tiantai Zhiyi 天台智顗 (538-597CE), the brilliant scholar-monk responsible for distilling the core doctrinal and practical program of this influential Chinese Buddhist sect. Underlying his relationship with Zhiyi, Huisi’s reputation as a key progenitor of Tiantai Buddhism is rooted in his rigorous, innovative teaching of what soon became the central scripture of Zhiyi’s Tiantai tradition—the Mahāyāna Buddhist text known as the Lotus Sūtra.</p>
				<p>In 756 CE, later Tiantai patriarch Zhanran湛然 (711-782CE) included a condensed account of the Tiantai school’s foundation and early history in his major commentarial work, A Resolution to Assist and Promote the Practice of ‘Concentration and Insight,’ especially emphasizing the authoritativeness of the institution’s relationship to the Lotus Sūtra. The brief but vivid biography of Huisi embedded in this text recounts how—consistent with a promise made to devotees in the Lotus Sūtra’s final chapter and the closely related Scripture on the Method for Visualizing the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra—this bodhisattva appeared to Huisi and imbued him with extraordinary powers of interpretation and meditative absorption.</p>
				<p>Shortly after its completion, a monk named Sengxiang 僧祥 (dates unknown) gently redacted Zhanran’s biography of Huisi and compiled it alongside a number of similarly wondrous tales in an anthology he titled Records of the Transmission of the Lotus Sūtra. This condensed, anthologized, likely more popular version is the text I have translated. Somewhat divorced from the elite, institution-building context of Zhanran’s work, Huisi’s hagiography takes on interestingly different flavours in Sengxiang’s setting: aimed less at forwarding any sectarian, historiographic agenda, here the tale acts more as a general promotion of the numinous power of the Lotus Sūtra, particularly in its tendency to ‘come true’ through wondrous, miraculous events in the lives of its devotees. It aims to stir its audience’s feelings with affectively charged language and abrupt supernatural interventions, which were likely played up to dramatic effect in oral retellings amongst both lay and monastic listeners. </p>
				<p>Beyond its implicit historical data, explicit biographical data, immediately engaging storytelling style, and tacit promotion of Lotus-centered devotion, however, the tale implies important Buddhist notions of sacred textuality: for instance, it suggests that understanding the notoriously challenging, sacred language of the Lotus Sūtra lies well beyond ordinary semiosis, in both its process and its consequences. Moreover, the salvific process of scriptural interpretation is played out through (and upon) the interpreter’s material body, which ultimately expresses their readerly and spiritual achievement in the purification of their sense-faculties and certain other, markedly fleshy transformations.</p>
				<p>As mentioned, Sengxiang’s Records of the Transmission of the Lotus Sūtra redacts and compiles numerous tales, many of them drawn from Tiantai school texts, in a chronology of the Lotus Sūtra’s transmission from the cosmic Buddha-realms of its original teaching, through India, and into China throughout the 3rd to 8th centuries CE. The compilation is structured almost identically to the earlier Records of the Transmission of the Flower Garland Scripture by the third patriarch of the Huayan 華嚴 school, Fazang 法藏 (643-712CE). According to Tiantai perspective, the central scripture of the Huayan school, the Flower Garland Scripture, was taught immediately after the Buddha’s enlightenment, whereas the Lotus Sūtra was preached in the final years of his life and is accordingly the more perfect and profound. Following this doxography, Sengxiang’s Records sits in competition with Fazang’s compilation, even as it duplicates its central structure.</p>
				<p>Mimicking Fazang’s text, the Records of the Transmission of the Lotus Sūtra is arranged into 12 chapters, spanning 10 rolls or fascicles in total. Beginning with a focus on the scriptural classification and superiority of the Lotus Sūtra, it moves on to chapters recounting the scripture’s journey to China, its translation from Sanskrit, and its interpretation, before moving on to chapters illustrating the miraculous potentials of preaching, copying, reciting, and hearing the scripture. The biography of Huisi translated here is redacted from Zhanran’s original text and inserted in chapter 8 (fascicle 3), which focuses on the spiritual and worldly benefits of reciting the Lotus Sūtra. Like many of its neighbours in the compilation, the tale exemplifies in lively fashion the Chinese concept of ganying 感應or “numinous response” to pious action.</p>
				<p>At the end of the final fascicle, there is a brief colophon by Monk Yuanzhi 圓智, who praises Sengxiang’s project and identifies himself as the editor and scribe of the transmitted edition.</p>
				<p>The text translated here is sourced from the Taishō edition of the Chinese Buddhist Canon or Tripitaka, produced by scholars in the 1920s and early 30s in Japan, and currently available in a digital edition through CBETA.  It is filed (along with Fazang’s Records of the Transmission of the Flower Garland Scripture) in volume 51 of the Taishō canon, which collects medieval Chinese histories of Buddhism. The Taishō critical edition of Sengxiang’s Records is based on an edition in the collection of Ōtani University, Kyōto, and collated with a manuscript edition in the collection of Tōdaiji temple, Nara, whose variant characters it records.</p>

				<p>Overview of the reception of the Lotus Sūtra in medieval Chinese society with specific reference to miracle tales. Campany argues that most people saw such scriptures not just as “doctrine delivery devices” but as sources of devotion that oriented and gave life to lay and monastic Buddhist practices. </p>

        			<p>Texts are translated into modern American English with maximum fidelity to the original text, except where it would impair comprehension or good style. Archaisms are preserved where they do not conflict with the aesthetic of the original text. Scribal errors and creative translation choices are marked and discussed in the critical notes.</p>
        			<p>Sengxiang’s prose moves briskly and somewhat disjointedly, through a chain of increasingly dramatic scenarios, with a relatedly rapid succession of images and other affective cues. The text’s emphasis on corporeality and affect establishes Huisi’s body as its primary arena, and elicits from the reader and immediate, sympathetic response. Indeed, its cues (hunger, intense joy, fear, anguish, illness) call us into an awareness of our own bodies and provoke by turns our curiosity, disgust, and relief. Unlike the elevated, long-winded, ethereal characteristics of many Buddhist scriptures, the concision, rhythm, and vividness of Sengxiang’s account of the progressive degradation of Huisi’s body provides a ground against which Samantabhadra’s miraculous appearance and the Buddhist terminology of the text’s conclusion sits in true, astonishing contrast, and reinforces a readerly experience of wonder. I have tried to retain all these characteristics in my English-language translation.</p>
