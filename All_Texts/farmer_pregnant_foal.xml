				<p>Introduction to the Tex</p>
				<p>The Farmer who Was Pregnant with a Foal is a comic poem by Hans Sachs (1494–1576), a cobbler and poet from Nuremberg. The work is an example of a Schwank: a genre of short, comic tales about mundane characters and situations, either in prose or verse.</p>
				<p>Sachs was one of the most prolific composers of Schwänke and other genres of text designed for public performance in Nuremberg. In all, over 6000 works are attributed to Sachs. He is perhaps best known for his leadership of the Nuremberg Singschule (singing school), a guild-like organization composed of local craftsmen that held gatherings at which members would perform songs that had to fulfil certain criteria of rhyme, meter, melody, and delivery. This tradition of Meistergesang (master song) is perhaps most known to modern audiences from the 1868 Richard Wagner opera Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg), in which Hans Sachs is a leading character.</p>
				<p>Other genres Sachs produced include dramatic tragedies and comedies based on Classical and Biblical source material, fables based on the writings of Aesop, religious treatises in support of Martin Luther and the Reformation, and Fastnachtspiele––short, usually comic dramas performed at the beginning of Lent. Hundreds of his works were printed as short pamphlets during Sachs’ lifetime and Sachs also compiled a multi-volume edition of his own collected works before his death.</p>
				<p>The Farmer who was Pregnant with a Foal concerns an unnamed farmer who develops a terrible stomachache after over-indulging in wine. He sends his servant to the doctor with a urine sample to inquire about his boss’s ailment (a standard method of diagnosis in sixteenth-century Germany). The servant accidentally spills the farmer’s urine along the way and refills the vial with the urine of the horse he is riding, leading the doctor to declare that the producer of the urine is pregnant with a foal. The simple-minded farmer takes the diagnosis seriously and goes out into the field to give birth to his foal. The poem is in many ways representative of Sachs’s work as a whole: the poem is short, entertaining, bawdy, preoccupied with gender roles and norms, and it pokes fun at the rural inhabitants of the area surrounding Nuremberg; a particular target of urban writers like Sachs.</p>
				<p>Introduction to the Source</p>
				<p>Hans Sachs dated the work December 9, 1557, although it was not printed until Sachs compiled his collected works in the late 1560s and early 1570s. This work appears in the second volume of his works, first printed in 1570. Two years after writing this Schwank, Sachs turned the work into a Fastnachtspiel. Both works were included in the 26-volume collected works of Sachs edited by Adelbert von Keller and Edmund Goetze between 1870 and 1908.</p>
				<p>About this Edition</p>
				<p>In our translation, we have tried to maintain the simple and, at times, crude language of Sachs’s text. We have not kept the rhyme scheme of the original work.</p>
