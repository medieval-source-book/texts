				<p>Li Qingzhao wrote in a note accompanying this <hi rend="italic">ci</hi> that it was inspired by Ouyang Xiu’s “To the tune of ‘Butterfly love’", which she greatly admired. Both <hi rend="italic">ci</hi> have a similar theme--the speaker's regret--and share a similar opening image of a courtyard (in Ouyang Xiu's version: "The courtyard is deep, how many layers of depth are there?”).</p>
