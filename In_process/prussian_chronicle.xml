                <p>This text is an excerpt from Simon Grunau’s Preussische Chronik, or Prussian Chronicle. The text is written in the Early New High German language (Frühneuhochdeutsch), and scholars believe that it was completed by around 1530. It was composed in Prussia (which today spans northern Poland and Russia’s Kaliningrad Oblast), most likely in the vicinity of Gdańsk.</p>
                <p>Little is known about the author Simon Grunau. He was a Dominican friar, born in Tolkmitsk in Prussia (which is near today’s Elbląg, Poland). He seems to have lived most of his life in Gdańsk, where he was particularly active preaching amongst the burghers. At the time when Grunau was writing, the position of the Dominican Order in Prussia was uncertain, not least due to the spread of Lutheranism across Prussia during the 1520s. The Lutheran Reformation had quickly reached and taken hold in Prussia, and this was a key concern for Grunau, not only due to Luther’s rejection of papal authority and monasticism, but also the social and doctrinal changes emerging as a result of Luther’s confrontation with the Catholic Church. In 1525, the Teutonic Order, the religious military order who had governed the majority of Prussia since the mid-thirteenth century, converted to Lutheranism and transformed their Catholic monastic state into a secular Lutheran Duchy. The impacts of these events are reflected in Grunau’s chronicle, highlighted by his open hostility to both Lutheranism and Duke Albert of Prussia (the first Duke of Prussia, and previous Grandmaster (leader) of the Teutonic Order).</p>
                <p>Grunau’s chronicle purports to give an account of the history of Prussia from the beginning of time until around 1530, and as such contains a wide variety of socioeconomic, religious and political narratives. In addition to exploring the pre-Christian lives of the Prussians and the religious changes mentioned above, Grunau interweaves passages concerning economic themes such as taxation and price and currency fluctuations, as well as political themes such as relations between Prussia, Poland and the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
                <p>The chronicle is a compilation of material from numerous sources, both narrative (other chronicles such as that of Peter von Dusburg) and documentary (such as the Treaty of Christburg, a legal and peace agreement between the Teutonic Order and Prussian tribes), as well as Grunau’s own experiences and material likely invented or seriously embellished by Grunau himself. As a result, its reliability and veracity are in question, and Grunau’s chronicle has often been wrongly dismissed as unworthy of study for this reason. There are numerous lines of enquiry still open with Grunau’s work, not least with respect to why and how he embellished his material, and what new narratives and identities he created in doing so.</p>
                <p>The excerpt included in the Global Medieval Sourcebook is an interesting account of the supposed pantheon of gods worshipped by the pre-Christian Prussians before the thirteenth century, combined with details of how they came to be deified and what exactly their worship entailed. Within this there are several elements: first, the obviously ritualistic elements of the ‘pagan’ worship of these gods, with gruesome sacrifice and quasi-ghostlike hauntings; second, the more worldly offerings Grunau suggests (such as various crops and animals), providing information about food and drink either found in Prussia or commonly known to his readers at the time. Finally, Grunau explores the foundation mythology of the Prussian people (the ‘Cimbri’ and ‘Bruteni’), in attempts to reimagine Prussian identity and heritage in a period of intense conflict and division. It is this external imagining of a different religion and culture which is most interesting, and the way in which Grunau uses it to delineate a Prussian identity. These are themes which are still incredibly relevant today. By studying embellished or imagined narratives, we can better understand the agendas of those writing them.</p>

	        	<p>Transcriptions and translations are encoded in XML conforming to TEI (P5) guidelines. The original-language text is contained within &lt;lem&gt; tags and translations within &lt;rdg&gt; tags.</p>
        		<interpretation>
        			<p>Texts are translated into modern American English with maximum fidelity to the original text, except where it would impair comprehension or good style. Archaisms are preserved where they do not conflict with the aesthetic of the original text. Scribal errors and creative translation choices are marked and discussed in the critical notes.</p>
                    <p>The printed edition from which this translation has been produced is a critical composition of several manuscripts of Grunau’s chronicle, some of which are no longer extant. Trust has been placed in the edition, due to both the editorial methods employed, and comparison with a sixteenth century copy of the autograph manuscript for fidelity. The use of multiple manuscript copies for the edition provides more confidence with regards to copying errors, and where inconsistencies between the manuscripts appear, editorial footnotes have been made. There are around ten remaining copies or partial copies of the manuscript, although the autograph manuscript is believed to have been lost when Königsberg State and University Library was destroyed during the Second World War. The number of copies and their varied locations (including Stockholm, Toruń, Berlin, Dresden, Vilnius and Gdańsk) is suggestive of a broad textual transmission, and there were claims that Grunau’s narratives were still widely circulating into the nineteenth century.</p>
                    <p>For the translation itself several dictionaries were consulted, such as the Frühneuhochdeutsches Wörterbuch by Oskar Reichmann and the Kleines Frühneuhochdeutsches Wörterbuch by Christa Baufeld. To maintain fidelity with the original, proper nouns have remained untranslated and with their original spellings, and where possible syntax has been preserved; occasionally it was necessary to modify this to make the English translation more readable.</p>

However, there is little evidence for the existence of an exact site of Rickoiot, and in creating his Rickoiot, Grunau almost certainly combined elements of Peter von Dusburg’s ‘Romovia’ and descriptions of other religious sites such as Adam of Bremen’s description of a sacred tree at Uppsala.</p></note>and he did not fulfil the promise soon, then [Patollo] played out the Passion with the offender, and his sacrifice was all expensive things.</rdg>
